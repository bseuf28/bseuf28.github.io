I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 12 Part 1:

I was curious for a while about how we were going to use code to get something other than a text related output and I thought it was a lot simpler than I thought to make animation, although I know that it is a simple animation. I was really confused on how it would be possible without going frame-by-frame on a computer drawing, so it really helped me understand a bit more. This piqued my curiosity and made me more excited about next semester's lab class.

* Lab 8 Part 1:

I really enjoyed this lab because I feel that the output is something that you can use your creativity to actually play around with. Although I struggled on this part of the lab I eventually was able to understand how arguments worked and how to number them correctly. I spent some time inputting random words to make random sandwiches and I enjoyed that.

* Lab 3 Part 2:

This was one of my favorite labs not because of the output, but because I enjoyed doing the math that the lab required. I remember being confused about the formula and why it was as complicated as I was until I realized that leap years made the amount of days in a year different which explained the complexity of the formula. It was the first time I had heard of the Julian Day Calendar so it was cool to find out about that as well.
